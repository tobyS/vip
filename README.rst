VIP (deprecated)
================

This repository is deprecated and not maintained anymore. Please do not use it.
Instead, setup your own VIM setup. If you need inspiration you find `my current
VIM setup on Github`__. Beside that, there is a new version of `PDV -
phpDocumentor for VIM`__, which generates doc blocks for you.
